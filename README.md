# WhiteBoardSolutions

Whiteboard coding is a standard part of technical interviews these days but solving problems without the aid of an integrated development environment (IDE) is a great way to solidify your programming knowledge. Walking through your thought process aloud is the best practice for articulating what you know, and it shows me the areas where I need to improve.

I personally love that it forces me to think on my feet. That along with the added pressure of performing in front of my peers has only encouraged growth.

These solutions all started as whiteboard problems.
